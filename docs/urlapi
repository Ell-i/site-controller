Here are some url schemes available on the ELL-i Site Controller software

The site controller is at port 8888 of server ip 10.1.1.2, so that the urls
will look like http://10.1.1.2:8888/something

Now, the 'something' is just a placeholder word and there are lots of more
complex scene triggering and querying. Here I have mapped a subset of the
urls you might need during Open Illuminati Hackathon. Two kinds of devices
are supported, which is reflected in the url schemes as well.

The urls for ELL-i lights have a base path and some query GET/POST parameters.

Base paths for ELL-i devices
----------------------------
/actuators/leds40            // reminder for Teemu// vallila-m
/actuators/leds41            // reminder for Teemu// vallila-m
/actuators/leds34            // reminder for Teemu// ahto-l
/actuators/leds35            // reminder for Teemu// ahto-l

These have parameters r, g and b, whose range of values are from 0 to 255.
Both GET and POST methods work, with GET being easier to debug using the
browser or curl.

A nice example url for shutting down the light at device "leds36" is:
   http://10.1.1.2:8888/actuators/leds36?r=0&g=0&b=0

This can be easily tested from the command line like so:
% curl '10.1.1.2:8888/actuators/leds34?r=0&g=0&b=0'
% curl '10.1.1.2:8888/actuators/leds35?r=255&g=255&b=255'

Many individual devices have urls mapped for them.
The individual ELL-i Leaf Node leds are addressed like this:
